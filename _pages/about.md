I am PhD student at s2Lab [https://s2lab.kcl.ac.uk/] who si focusing his researches over the integration of Machine Learning Techniques and Malware Analysis. But this is not my only interest in CyberSec :)
I'm a curious person who spend time also on bug bounty and PenTest platforms as HTB.


Have fun!
